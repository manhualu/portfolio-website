          I&apos;m also a

          where I lead a team of 10 to continuously improve and deploy new
          features for Notangles. This involves utilising Jira + Confluence,
          reviewing Github pull requests and attending weekly meetings +
          standups.

          also held free workshops that taught students of years 7 to 12 Python,
